# Things 2 Do

[Things2Do][] was our group submission to [Young Rewired State 2013][yrs]. It's a 
simple search driven service which collates a combination of different data sources 
(for places, weather forecasts, movies, etc) and combines these to give a smart 
result based on your location (and what you wish to do). It looks like this:

It's written in PHP, using the CodeIgniter framework. The web interface is
responsive and has been tested over a wide variety of devices. But, there's still
a few bugs.
